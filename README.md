## House Price Estimation Using ML Methods

In this project we develop and implement different regression methods on datasets with a large number of both numerical and categorical features. We will explore linear regression as well as ensemble methods such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. We then evaluate each methods advantages along with their limitations such as overfitting. 

### Code
The code is divided to four categories:

1. The [Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Preprocessing.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook contains the code to preprocess the raw data. 
2. The [Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Regression.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook contains the linear regression methods
3. The [Random_Forest.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Random_Forest.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook contains the random forest regression model. 
4. The [Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/tree/master/Gradient%20Boosting) file contains MATLAB files to implement gradient boosting method. 

More description of the project can be found on [Description.pdf](https://github.com/MehradSm/House-Price-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning-Methods/blob/master/Description.pdf) pdf file.

This is a group project done by Gabrielle Belok, Artin Spiridonoff and Me, Supervised by Professor Prakash Ishwar.
